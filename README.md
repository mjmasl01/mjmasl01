### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-based analytics. I earned a B.S. in Data Science from St. Lawrence University in May 2024, where I focused on applied statistics, advanced modeling, and database systems. I recently completed my M.S. in Data Science at Boston University, with coursework in Bayesian statistics, machine and deep learning, AI ethics and privacy, medical science, financial analytics, and big data engineering using Azure.
My work spans health analytics, finance, sports, and public survey data. Notable projects include building Azure-based pipelines and sentiment models for cryptocurrency analysis, creating Shiny dashboards and Power BI visualizations for public health and sports data, and developing predictive models for depression risk using NHANES survey and clinical data. I also contributed to a published clinical research article on hemodynamic monitoring in cardiac patients.
Whether it involves regression modeling, cloud infrastructure, or storytelling through dashboards, I enjoy using data to solve real-world problems with clarity and impact.
